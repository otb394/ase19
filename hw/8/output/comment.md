Yes, the trees generated in this homework are "good" because they enable us to have different models in different localities of the data. We create the decision tree contrasting each cluster with the cluster it most envies (near + better) and the decision tree learnt help us in understanding how and which attributes differenciate our cluster with a nearby, better cluster. It does not try to generalize the same model over all data.
