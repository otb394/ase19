In the output.md file, we have printed the mean scores with α values 0.1, 0.3, 0.5 and 0.7. Strictly speaking, α values define what range of the cosine distance will be considered for a row to be marked as anomalous with increase in α values resulting in larger range and thus more rows to be considered anomalous. But from our data runs, we have observed that these changes in α values causes negligible difference in the mean same scores observed on both the data sets.
