In my opinion local reasoning has merit. While there are global insights, which are common across most (if not all) projects like "more coupling between components, increases instability" or "SOLID principles", there are many insights which hold true for a subset of data only and not at all for others. For example, the correlation of inter package references with instability, hold true for projects with component based package structures, but not ones with layer based package structures. These localized insights can improve the predictive power of the model, if the local "community" of the input is taken into consideration. Therefore, if we only stick to global reasoning, we'll only identify global insights, but miss out on very useful local insights, which localized models give us. Therefore, in my opinion a mixture of both approaches will help us identify the localized as well as global insights and enable us to predict better.
